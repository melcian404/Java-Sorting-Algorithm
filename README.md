    Project Description
  </summary>
  
The origin of this school project is a software developer working with a client named Grazioso Salvare.  They possess a database of search and rescue animals, including dogs and monkeys. Dogs are tracked by name, breed, gender, age, and weight. Monkeys are tracked by name, gender, age, weight, tail length, height, body length, and species. We were given a starter code and needed to create a monkey class inherited from the RescueAnimal class. We needed to complete the Driver class by adding a menu loop to display the menu, menu prompts, and actions, complete the dog intake methods, create a monkey intake method, a reserve animal method, and a print animal list method. This project was completed using Java with the Eclipse IDE on 04/02/23.
