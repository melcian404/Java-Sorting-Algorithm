    Project Description
  </summary>
  
The origin of this school project is a software developer working with a client named Grazioso Salvare.  They possess a database of search and rescue animals, including dogs and monkeys. Dogs are tracked by name, breed, gender, age, and weight. Monkeys are tracked by name, gender, age, weight, tail length, height, body length, and species. We were given a starter code and needed to create a monkey class inherited from the RescueAnimal class. We needed to complete the Driver class by adding a menu loop to display the menu, menu prompts, and actions, complete the dog intake methods, create a monkey intake method, a reserve animal method, and a print animal list method. This project demonstrates proficiency in using Java, algorithms, and arrays. This project was completed using Java with the Eclipse IDE on 04/02/23.

    Enhancement Plan
  </summary>
  
After reviewing the original project, I noticed several logic flaws that prevented menu prompts from working. I’ll need to debug the issues to get all prompts working correctly. The original code was disorganized and scattered illogically, so I’ll need to reorder it and add more concise comments explaining the functions of the code. After this, I’ll implement sorting algorithms to produce a more organized output.

  <summary>Enhancements Completed</summary>

  -  Fixed logic errors to get the project completely functional.
  -  Reorganized the code to follow best practices.
  -  Used clear and concise inline comments with function details for readers.
  -  Added two sorting algorithms to Driver file to print an alphabetically organized list for users.
